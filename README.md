# Inter

Since Google Fonts only offers an outdated version of [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) that doesn't ship with all [glyphs](https://rsms.me/inter/#glyphs),
here is a package with Inter v4 as originally distributed by [RSMS](https://rsms.me).

[Inter on GitHub](https://github.com/rsms/inter)

```bash
npm i --save dist-font-inter
```

## Usage

Import the static Inter font:

```js
import "dist-font-inter";
```

And use it in your styles as follows:

```CSS
body {
  font-family: "Inter";
}
```

### Variable Font

Alternatively, it is also possible to import the variable font:

```js
import "dist-font-inter/variable";
```

And then used it as follows:

```CSS
body {
  font-family: "InterVariable";
}
```
